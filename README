Now back to the verilog-mode:

This minor release adds enhanced highlighting, especially the ability
to gray out code that is turned off by things like translate_off
directives.

The major new recent feature is a 'verilog cockpit' that allows you to
select your   'Compliation  Action'.   Basically, you   select 'Choose
Compilation Action',  the  first item   in the Verilog  menu  bar, and
select Lint, Coverage, Simulation or Compilation as your action.

Then M-x compile will perform that action, and M-x next-error will
allow you to step through any errors.  Select 'Customise Verilog Mode'
from the same menu bar to customize the default choices for your
environment.

The addition of this  feature is no   accident; we have just  released
SureLint 1.1.   This  tool _statically_  finds races  in  your design,
finds unused code, automatically  finds  FSMs and diagnoses  them  for
reachability, as well as performing  the  standard lint checks.   Call
now for a demo!

The major  version 3 feature (hence the  new major release  number) is
AUTO, from  Wilson  Snyder, wsnyder\@wsnyder.org.  AUTO  provides  a
rich  set of     capabilities for  automatically    generating   input
declarations, or sensitivity lists.  To learn  more, install the file,
and pull down the Verilog Menu bar, and select Help

To install this file, go to

<http://www.surefirev.com/emacs_install.html>

and read the directions.

If you have  any problems with  the  file, feel  from to send  mail to
verilog-mode-bugs\@surefirev.com and your  mail will be entered in  our
bug tracking system.

various new features are announced all the time, which may interest
