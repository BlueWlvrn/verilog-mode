Company  News:

	There are still a few more opportunities for you to help
	build better verification tools.

	We have some great openings worldwide at Verisity, both in the
	development of tools for Verification, and in helping
	customers use these tools effectively.  If you have _any_
	interest, please drop me an email. (mac@verilog.com, or
	mac@verilog.com; or send directly to jobs@verisity.com)

Now back to the verilog-mode:

Major changes: 

1) The AUTO mode gained some new enhancements, many as suggested (and
contributed) by users.  As always, more is forthcoming.

2) Users of the AUTOs in Verilog that are also using SystemC may be
interested in Wilson Snyder's publicly licensed SystemPerl package,
which brings AUTOs and several other features to SystemC.  See
http://www.veripool.org

3) I now send this file as a mime encoded attachement.  If
you have problems decoding the file, search for the program mmencode.
I include a link to mmencode for various operating systems on the page 
<http://www.verilog.com/emacs_install.html>

4) This version has much more support for working with verilog Lint
programs; allowing easy stepping through the source code for which the
lint tool is pointing out problems; and simple key stroke to tell the
tool to ignore the error/warning.

To install this file, go to

<http://www.verilog.com/emacs_install.html>

and read the directions.

If you have  any problems with  the  file, feel  from to send  mail to
verilog-mode-bugs\@verilog.com and your  mail will be entered in  our
bug tracking system.

Please keep an eye on our web page <http://www.verisity.com> as
various new features are announced all the time, which may interest
you.
