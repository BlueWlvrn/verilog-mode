General News:

During _some_ of the time I am not enhancing the verilog mode :-), I
serve as the Senior VP of Simulation at Verisity Design
<http://www.verisity.com>, the home of SpeXsim, a native code compiles
simulator which supports Verilog, VHDL, SystemC and Specman execution
all with a direct kernel interface; and supports execution on
workstations running Solaris or Linux and running on our hardware
accelerators (Xcite, Xtreme and Xtreme Server).

We have openings for developers, application engineers and for
customers; if interested, send me an email at <mac@verilog.com>

Now back to the verilog-mode:

Major changes: 

1) Beginning of support for System Verilog!

2) The AUTO mode gained some new enhancements, many as suggested (and
contributed) by users.  As always, more is forthcoming.

3) Users of the AUTOs in Verilog that are also using SystemC may be
interested in Wilson Snyder's publicly licensed SystemPerl package,
which brings AUTOs and several other features to SystemC.  See
http://www.veripool.org

4) I now send this file as a mime encoded attachement.  If
you have problems decoding the file, search for the program mmencode.
I include a link to mmencode for various operating systems on the page

Please keep an eye on our web page <http://www.verisity.com> as
various new features are announced all the time, which may interest
you.
