General News:

As I write this we are a few weeks into the Verisity - Cadence merger.

Hence I find myself employed at the place that made the simulator
(Verilog-XL) we dethroned as the little startup called Chronologic,
some dozen years ago.  Life is truly stranger than fiction.

On another issue, I moved www.verilog.com to a new ISP, as the former
one has been very unreliable during the past 4 months. I aplogize for
the downtime, and thank the users who let me know the site was broken
in the various ways each time.

The new ISP is at my house (Shhh! Don't tell my wife!)

Now back to the verilog-mode:

Major changes: 

1) More System Verilog support. Many improvements to
indentation. Improvements to some v2k features. Many smaller
contributed fixes and ideas from users (Thanks!)

2) The AUTO mode gained some new enhancements, many as suggested (and
contributed) by users.  As always, more is forthcoming.

3) Users of the AUTOs in Verilog that are also using SystemC may be
interested in Wilson Snyder's publicly licensed SystemPerl package,
which brings AUTOs and several other features to SystemC.  See
http://www.veripool.org

4) I now send this file as a mime encoded attachement.  If
you have problems decoding the file, search for the program mmencode.
I include a link to mmencode for various operating systems on the page
