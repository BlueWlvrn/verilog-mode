General News:

Now that I have converted completely to using subversion for change
management, the user visible bit is that version numbers are no longer
monotonically increasing per file (instead increase by leaps and
bounds as each change I make to any file in the verilog-mode build
hierarchy (tests, Makefiles, et cetera) increments the number) hence
version 206 might be just a little better than version 183.

Now back to the verilog-mode:

Major changes: 

1) More System Verilog support. Many improvements to
indentation. Improvements to some v2k features. Many smaller
contributed fixes and ideas from users (Thanks!)

2) The AUTO mode gained some new enhancements, many as suggested (and
contributed) by users.  As always, more is forthcoming.

3) Users of the AUTOs in Verilog that are also using SystemC may be
interested in Wilson Snyder's publicly licensed SystemPerl package,
which brings AUTOs and several other features to SystemC.  See
http://www.veripool.org

4) I now send this file as a mime encoded attachement.  If
you have problems decoding the file, search for the program mmencode.
I include a link to mmencode for various operating systems on the page 
<http://www.verilog.com/emacs_install.html>

To learn more on installing this file, go to

<http://www.verilog.com/emacs_install.html>

and read the directions.

If you have any problems with the file, feel free to send mail to mac
at verilog dot com and I will take a look.
