    It's suggesting that verilog-comment-regiont and verilog-uncomment-region
    can (probably) be dropped when running under Emacs>=21 (and the C-c C-c
    binding could also be removed if you assume your users will use M-;)

    Better use:
    
    (defvar verilog-mode-map
      (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
        (define-key map ";"        'electric-verilog-semi)
        ... etc etc

    - Remove verilog-running-on-xemacs and use (featurep 'xemacs) instead
      (without storing its value in a variable): the byte-compiler will then
      be able to optimize away the unapplicable code (and correspondingly skip
      some silly warnings).
    - Rather than create a new syntax-table in each buffer, just do
    
       (defvar verilog-mode-syntax-table
         (let ((st (make-syntax-table)))
           (modify-syntax-table ...)
           ...
           st))
    
      once and forall (inlining the only calls to verilog-setup-dual-comments
      and verilog-populate-syntax-table).
      Regarding verilog-setup-dual-comments, even if you consider the XEmacs
      solution cleaner, the Emacs solution is not only equivalent but it also
      works under XEmacs, so you can use it everywhere and remove an
      emacs-version check.
    - in verilog-modi-cache-results, you check (memq 'v19 verilog-emacs-features)
      additionally to (boundp 'font-lock-mode) which is redundant (same thing
      in verilog-auto).
    - You can then remove the verilog-emacs-features abomination.
    - The part
    
             (require 'verilog-mode)
    
      is pretty hideous and deserves either to be fixed (i.e. removed), or large
      comments justifying each part.
      Also some of the subsequent requires are unneeded (e.g. the `imenu' one).
    - Use easy-menu-add rather than add-submenu so it works on both Emacs
      and XEmacs.
    - the code in the major mode function which sets up the menu has a comment
      claiming this is about font-lock ;-)
    - Emacs-21's comment-region and uncomment-region should work correctly
      (including mangling nested comments, although in a different way from the
      one you chose).
